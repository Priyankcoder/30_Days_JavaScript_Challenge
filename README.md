 I know the basics of the Javascript but now I want to learn the nuances of it that's why I am starting from the scratch.

## Day 1:
* Completed the first section of ES6 tutorial from this [website](https://javascript.info/). It has detailed tutorials and the author tells explicity about the do's and dont's from his own experience.So, I will follow these tutorials throughout this challenge.
* I build a [*Virtual_Drum_Kit*](https://github.com/Priyankcoder/30_Days_JavaScript_Challenge/tree/master/D1-Virtual_Drum_Kit) with the help of [Wes Bos tutorial](https://javascript30.com/)  and It gave me clarity of how eventlisteners work and I will do one js project daily by refering his
[tutorials](https://javascript30.com/) .

## Day 2:
* Revised the JavaScript fundamentals (Code structure,
The modern mode, "use strict",
Variables and
Data types)
* Build a [*Destiny_Decider_Dices*](https://github.com/Priyankcoder/30_Days_JavaScript_Challenge/tree/master/D2-Destiny_Decider_Dices) game. This game has two dices which show numbers on refreshing the page and player corresponding to the dice with greater number wins and it displays the winner. You can use it to resolve the conflicts 😄 and to play monopoly. There are endless use-cases of it .
* I didn't learn any new algorithm from few days. So, I learned and practice Knuth–Morris–Pratt string-searching algorithm today and It's amazing 🤩.
