 I know the basics of the Javascript but now I want to learn the nuances of it that's why I am starting from the scratch.

## Day 1:
* Completed the first section of ES6 tutorial from this [website](https://javascript.info/). It has detailed tutorials and the author tells explicity about the do's and dont's from his own experience.
* I build a *Virtual_Drum_Kit* with the help of [Wes Bos tutorial](https://javascript30.com/)  and It gave me clarity of how eventlisteners work and I will do one js project daily by refering to
[Wes Bos tutorial](https://javascript30.com/) .
