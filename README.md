# Motive:
> I created this repository to track my 30_days_JavaScript_Challenge progress and learning.
 I know the basics of the Javascript but now I want to learn the nuances of it that's why I am starting from the scratch.

## Day 1:
* Completed the first section of ES6 tutorial from this [website](https://javascript.info/). It has detailed tutorials and the author tells explicity about the do's and dont's from his own experience.So, I will follow these tutorials throughout this challenge.
* I build a [*Virtual_Drum_Kit*](https://github.com/Priyankcoder/30_Days_JavaScript_Challenge/tree/master/D1-Virtual_Drum_Kit) with the help of [Wes Bos tutorial](https://javascript30.com/)  and It gave me clarity of how eventlisteners work.So, I will do some js project by refering his
[tutorials](https://javascript30.com/) .

## Day 2:
* Revised the JavaScript fundamentals (Code structure,
The modern mode, "use strict",
Variables and
Data types)
* Build a [*Destiny_Decider_Dices*](https://github.com/Priyankcoder/30_Days_JavaScript_Challenge/tree/master/D2-Destiny_Decider_Dices) game. This game has two dices which show numbers on refreshing the page and player corresponding to the dice with greater number wins and it displays the winner. You can use it to resolve the conflicts ðŸ˜„ and to play monopoly. There are endless use-cases of it .
* I didn't learn any new algorithm from few days. So, I learned and practice [Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt string-searching algorithm](https://github.com/Priyankcoder/Non_Linear_Data_Structures/blob/master/Python_Implementation/Binary_Tree/Knuth_Morris_Pratt.md) today and It's amazing ðŸ¤©.

## Day 3:
* Revised array and its methods, some of them are forEach(can be used as labeling event-listener to each element of a array, no for loop required. I like these kind of subtle tricks a lot ðŸ˜‹ ), filter, map, sort, find and findIndex.
* Practiced array exercise which helped me to gain insight on where and how to use these function in real scenario .
* Read a blog on semantic HTML.

## Day 4: 
* Read tutorials of JS on Interaction(alert, prompt and confirm), Type Conversions,
Basic operators, maths and Comparisons .
* Read a tutorial on flexbox in css and it will surely make my life easier ðŸ˜¸. 

## Day 5: 
* Read tutorials of JS as usual and learned some new concept.
* Learned a new string algorithm to find longest palindrome in string aka [Manachar's Algorithm]([Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt string-searching algorithm](https://github.com/Priyankcoder/Non_Linear_Data_Structures/blob/master/CPP_Implementation/Manachar's_Algorithm.md).
